In this video, I walk you through the process of creating a Stopwatch app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I explain the structure of the code and demonstrate how the app functions. We start with the index.html file, where we set up the basic structure and add the timer icon. Then, we move on to the CSS file, where we style the elements and create the neon effect for the timer. Finally, we dive into the JavaScript code, where we set the initial timer values and create the functionality for the start, stop, and reset buttons. By the end of the video, you'll have a clear understanding of how to build your own timer app.
